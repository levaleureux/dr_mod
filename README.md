# How to use it.

For now there is 2 screen

1. main   screen, with the traker
2. sample screen, with the sample visualisation

## key

on main screen you can press
1. 'space' to play
2. 's' to go to the sample screen
3. 'r' to reset

on the sample screen you can press

1. 'c' to go back to tracker screen
2. 'todo' to play sample
3. 'todo' on play mode press a note key to play it
4. 'todo' to switch notation system, English and frensh

# Why I implement more than one notation system.

1. I'm french so I learn music with the french system (make sence).
2. It's more easy to debug something that is more easy to read and understand
   for you.
3. I belive the more you train you brain with cultural difference, the bettre
   you understand what difference and history mean, and become a more savy and
   good citizen :) :) (don't fight make people smart :) )
